# thesongcalendar

Howdy Folks!<br><br>
This account is merely a listing of songs.<br>
Beginning January 1st, I will post at least one song for each calendar day.<br>
<br>
Rules:<br>
1. The song contains a reference to what I deem to be an undisputable month & day.<br>
2. This reference must be in either the lyrics or song title.<br>
<br>
Who: I'm [Joey Liechty](https://twitter.com/yeahdef)<br>
I'm a DJ, computer wizard and archivist.<br>
Several people have told me that I resemble Glenn Danzig.<br>
<br>
What: This is a listing of songs that reference every day of the calendar year.<br>
<br>
When: The idea came into my head in the fall of the 2020 COVID-19 global pandemic.<br>
<br>
Where: I live in Denton, TX.<br>
<br>
Why: My girlfriend Katherine mused, "I wonder how many days in a year you could say a song is named after?", so I decided to start compiling a list.<br>
<br>
Special Thanks:<br>
Katherine Treff - My girlfriend. She instigated a research project that lasted months. She assisted with finding some entries and did some QA of the list items.<br>
Richard A. Marini - A reporter with the San Antonio Express-News who started his own similar project as part of a now-defunct ["Favorite Office Time Waster" blog] (https://blog.mysanantonio.com/timewasters/). Early in my research, I found his as-yet-incomplete list. His list made me realize that my list was indeed possible.<br>
