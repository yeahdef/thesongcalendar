# thesongcalendar

Howdy Folks!

This account is merely a listing of songs.
Beginning January 1st, I will post at least one song for each calendar day.

Rules:
1. The song contains a reference to what I deem to be an undisputable month & day.
2. This reference must be in either the lyrics or song title.

Who: I'm [Joey Liechty](https://twitter.com/yeahdef)
I'm a DJ, computer wizard and archivist.
I performed the bulk of the research and compilation of the data.
Several people have told me that I resemble Glenn Danzig.

What: This is a listing of songs that reference every day of the calendar year.

When: The idea came into my head in the fall of the 2020 COVID-19 global pandemic.

Where: I live in Denton, TX.

Why: My girlfriend Katherine mused, "I wonder how many days in a year you could say a song is named after?", so I decided to start compiling a list.

Special Thanks:
Katherine Treff - My girlfriend. She instigated a research project that lasted months. She assisted with finding some entries and did some QA of the list items.

Richard A. Marini - A reporter with the San Antonio Express-News who started his own similar project as part of a now-defunct [Favorite Office Time Waster blog](https://blog.mysanantonio.com/timewasters/).

Early in my research, I found his partial list.

His list made me realize that my list was indeed possible.
